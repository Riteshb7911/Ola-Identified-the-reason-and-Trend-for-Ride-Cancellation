# Ola-Identified-the-reason-and-Trend-for-Ride-Cancellation
## Problem Statement
OLA Ride Services in Bengaluru faces challenges in understanding and optimizing its ride booking operations due to the lack of clear data insights. The company struggles with managing booking success rates (targeted at 62%), cancellations (≤7% by customers, ≤18% by drivers), and incomplete rides (<6%). Additionally, demand fluctuates on weekends and match days, impacting revenue and resource allocation. The absence of a structured analytical approach makes it difficult to identify key trends in ride demand, cancellation reasons, driver performance, and fare distribution.

This will enable OLA to optimize driver allocation, reduce cancellations, enhance customer experience, and maximize earnings through data-driven decisions.
